Teaser bets are popular sports bets (particularly in football and basketball) because it allows you to adjust the point spread in your favor. Teasers are used in parlay bets (bets linking together two or more wagers) and whatever teaser amount you choose will apply to all wagers within your bet.

Teasers allow you to have an advantageous point spread while selecting 2 to 8 teams (or more depending on the sportsbook). You may tease a side or a total of a football game and also cross sports by teasing football games with basketball games.

Use out Teaser Calculator to determine the outcome of any particular teaser combination. Our Teaser Calculator allows you to select up to 14 teams in a teaser bet.
