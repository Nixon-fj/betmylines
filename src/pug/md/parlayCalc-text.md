A parlay is a single bet that links together two or more individual wagers for a high payout. In order for the parlay bet to win, every one of the wagers must win.

So why make a parlay bet if itâ€™s a more difficult bet? Because the payouts are higher. A 2 team parlay might pay 13/5, a three team parlay might pay 6/1, a four team parlay might pay 10/1, and so on with the payouts getting higher with more teams.

The Parlay Calculator is a handy tool to calculate the payoff of parlay bets.
