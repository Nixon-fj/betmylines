It is our responsibility to ensure that all of our customers are provided a safe and secure gaming experience with the help of a fully trained staff that can spot signs of gambling addiction and how to help and protect our members with these problems. To assist our players in playing responsibly, we provide a selection of options:

- Account and gambling limits.
- Time out periods.
- Self-exclusion periods.
- Customer Support available 24/7.
- Custom tools to help you manage your casino action.
- Direct links to responsible gambling organizations.
- Gambling Management Tools

We understand that, at times, it can be difficult for you to control your gambling. Using our different gambling management tools, we have you covered. In a few easy steps, contact our customer support team, and you can set daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limits to protect you from a gambling problem.

**Please note:** For the protection of our players, we give the option to limit your balance. At any time, with the help of our customer support team, you can increase or decrease your limit. An increase in limits can take up to 24 hours to be completed. When limits are created, it is up to the player to follow them. Players should stick to the limits they set and not create another account in order to get around these limits. We are not responsible for any losses outside of limits set by players

**Access Control Level 1 – Time Out Period** Sometimes you simply need time away, and we offer a time-out period ranging from 24 hours to 6 weeks where you can have the customer support team temporarily freeze your account.

**Access Control Level 2 – Self Exclusion** If you need more than simply a time out, you are able to block yourself from your account for a much larger period of time. Our self-exclusion period allows customer support to block you from accessing your account for a minimum of six months to 5 years. Following the self-exclusion time period, players will need to contact customer support in order to reopen their account. Self-excluded accounts will be reopened 24 hours after the request is heard.

**Please note:** When you freeze or exclude yourself from your account, it is the player’s responsibility not to reopen the account. Please contact customer support if you are able to access your account while it is closed.
