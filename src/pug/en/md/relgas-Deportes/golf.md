**For Matchups** the player must tee off in order to be considered action. If a player does not tee off, then any wager involving him would be considered no action and will be cancelled.The exception to this rule is when the wager is made on a pool and all players have action regardless if they start or not the tournament. (ex: to win TOURNAMENT)

**If a players tees off**, he is in action regardless of the number of holes played.

**Example of a Tournament Matchup:**

**Fred Funk -125**
**Joe Durant +105**
In this tournament match-If a customer picks Fred Funk, the wager is on Fred Funk to have a better record than Joe Durant. Not necessarily that Funk must win the championship but that he will end up in a better position than Durant. Both players must Tee Off in the tournament for the matchup to have action. In a two-player match-up wager, the player completing the most holes is declared the winner. If both players complete the same number of holes then the lowest score wins.

**Specific Rounds:** Aside the odds to win the whole Tournament, we may also offer odds to win a specific round. So a customer can bet on a player to win the 3rd round only. If this is the case we will specify that the bet is for the round only and not for the whole tournament. Both players must tee off in the specified round for action. 4th round does not include playoffs

**When a point scoring method is used** such as Stableford, then the highest number of point wins. The only exception to this rule is when a tournament is rain shortened and the final scores are determined by the PGA usually by reverting back to the last completed round.

On Top Player betting or Group betting if two or more players tie for the best place in the pool, the prices of the wagers will be divided by the number of the winning players.

We ONLY accept Straight Bets when wagering on Golf regardless if it is a wager on To Win Tournament, Top 5, Top 10, Tournament Matchups, Round Matchups or Top Player Betting. Any other type of wager that is not a straight wager (Example: Parlays, If Bets, Reverses and/or Round Robins) will be cancelled by us without prior notice.
