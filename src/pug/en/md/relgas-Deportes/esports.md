1. The start dates and times displayed on our website for E-Sport matches are an indication only and are not guaranteed to be correct. If a match is suspended or postponed, and not resumed within 12 hours from the actual scheduled start time, then wagers on the match will have no action and be refunded.
The exception being any wager on whether a team/player advances in a tournament, or wins the tournament, will have action regardless of a suspended or postponed match.

2. If the name of a player/team is misspelled, all bets will stand unless it is obvious it is the wrong object.
3. If in an official match a player plays with the wrong nickname or on a smurf-account, the result is still valid unless it is evident that it is not the player that was supposed to play that match.
4. All wagers will be settled using the official result as declared by the relevant governing body of the competition concerned.
5. If a draw option has not been made available, then extra time will count, if played.
6. **Handicap betting:** A spread in E-Sports can be Rounds/Maps or other counting measures dependent on the game. The spread will only be referred to as the spread. (For example, in Counter Strike the spread will be rounds won, while in Starcraft 2 the spread would be maps).
Handicapping is a way of making a sports contest more even and thus more interesting as a betting object. In E-Sports betting, this is done by awarding one of the teams/players, the underdog, some maps/rounds ahead

**For example:**
|          |**Handicap**| **Odds**|
|----------|------------|---------|
| Player A |       -1.5 |    2.00 |
| Player B |       +1.5 |    1.85 |

If Player A wins the match by two maps or more, Player A bettors win and Player B bettors lose. If Player A wins by exactly one map or Player B wins, Player B bettors win and Player A bettors lose.

Total Betting: A total in E-sports can be Rounds/Maps or other counting measures dependent on the game. The total will only be referred to as the total.
**Example for a best of three SC2 Match:**
|          |           |         |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Over     |       2.5 |    1.93 |
| Under    |       2.5 |    1.93 |

If either player wins 2-0 all bets on under 2.5 will win, while bets on the over will lose. If either player wins 2-1 all bets on the over win, while bets on the under lose.

If a map is not completed because of a player retirement or disqualification, all bets on the outcome will have action and will be validated based on the official declared winner. Counter-Strike maps are exceptions to this rule, for which all moneyline, spread and total bets are canceled if a team retires or is disqualified before all scheduled map rounds are played.
If the announced number of maps/rounds is changed all bets on the handicap or total are cancelled. Bets on the moneyline (outcome of the match) have action.
If a player or team receives a walkover or win by admin decision on at least one map, all wagers on the series (moneyline, spread and total) will be canceled and monies refunded. In CS:GO, if a team retires or is disqualified before all scheduled rounds on a map are played, all wagers on the series (moneylines, spread and total) will be canceled and monies refunded as well.
