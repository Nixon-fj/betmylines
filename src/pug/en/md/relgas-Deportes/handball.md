Unless otherwise stated all bets will be settled based on the score at the end of regulation time and excluding overtime if played. All match betting markets are based on the result at the end of a scheduled 60 minutes play unless otherwise stated. If the scheduled 60 minutes is not played then bets will be void, with the exception of game props where the result has already been determined.

The following markets include overtime/shootouts for settlement purposes:

- To Qualify
- To Lift Trophy

Specifically for any competition that uses a Mercy Rule, in the event of such a Rule being called in a match, all bets will stand on the score at the time.

If a match venue is changed then bets already placed will stand providing the home team is still designated as such. If the home and away team for a listed match play the fixture at the away team venue then bets will stand providing the home team is still officially designated as such.

If the home and away team for a listed match play the fixture at the away team venue then bets will stand providing the home team is still officially designated as such, otherwise bets will be void.
