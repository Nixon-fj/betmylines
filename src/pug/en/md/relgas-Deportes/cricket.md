**Including Twenty/20**
**General:**

1. All wagers will be settled using the official result as declared by the relevant governing body of the match or competition concerned.
2. Change of Venue:
If a match venue is changed then bets already placed will stand providing the home team is still designated as such. If the home and away team for a listed match are reversed then bets placed based on the original listing will be void.
3. If a match is abandoned due to outside interference, bets on the outcome for the total of the game are voided, if no winner is declared from the official site all bets on the winner of the match are voided.
4. If a match is affected by external factors (such as bad weather), we will settle your bet based on the official competition rule (this includes matches affected by a mathematical calculation such as the Duckworth-Lewis method (DL) or the Jayadevan system (VJD)*).
*Duckworth Lewis method / Jayadevan system
These are systems used to adjust the scores in the event of a rain delay during one-day matches, in order to leave the balance of the match unaltered. The systems use the number of overs each team have still to receive and the number of wickets they have in hand in order to reach an official result.
5. Where no price is quoted for the tie and the official competition rules do not determine a winner then all wagers will be graded cancelled. In competitions where a bowl out or super over determines a winner, then bets will be settled on the official result.

**Series Betting:**
If a series is drawn and no draw option was offered then all bets will be considered a push and refunded.

**Test Matches:**

1. In case the game did not go at least 4 innings all bets on the outcome for the over/under are voided.
2. In case the game did not go at least 4 innings all bets on the outcome for the winner of the match are settled based on the official announcement
3. Tied Test Match:
In the event of a tied test match (i.e. where all innings have been completed and both teams have the same score) all bets on the game will be voided
4. If a three-way money line with the draw as the third betting option is offered, only those bettors who wagered on the draw will be paid as winners; those who wagered on either team or contestant to win will lose their stake.
5. If a test match is abandoned or disrupted by outside interference (riot, etc) all bets on this match are void.

**One Day Internationals:**

1. In case the game did not go at least the official number of overs, all bets on the outcome for the over/under are voided.
2. In case the game did not go at least the official number of overs, all bets on the outcome for the winner of the match are settled based on the official announcement.
3. In matches where a reserve day is used all wagers will stand and carry over to the reserve day.
