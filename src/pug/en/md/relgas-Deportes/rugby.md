If any match ends in a draw/tie, including overtime if played, then stakes will be refunded unless a price is offered for the draw/tie. Bets will be graded on official AFL result only.

**Matches not Played as Listed**
If a match venue is changed then bets already placed will stand providing the home team is still designated as such. If the home and away team for a listed match are reversed then bets placed based on the original listing will be void.
