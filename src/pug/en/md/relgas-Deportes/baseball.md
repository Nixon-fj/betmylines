- Games are official after 5 innings of play unless the home team is winning after 4 and a half innings.
- After 5 innings of play, if the game is called or suspended, the final score (for wagering purposes) is determined by the last full inning of play unless the home team scores to tie or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning. In which case, the winner is determined by the score when the game is called.
- Regular Season Games that are suspended or postponed do not carry over to the following day. However, for MLB PostSeason, World Baseball Classic (WBC) Final and Semi Finals games that are suspended or postponed, bets will carry over until the game is ruled final.
- College World Series games that are suspended are considered to be in a long rain delay and will be graded when the game reaches its official ending.
- Scheduled 7 Inning MLB Games: For Runline (Spread) and Total (over/under) wagers to have action, the game must go 7 innings or 6Â½ if the home team is winning.
- On Mexican Baseball games for action on RUN LINES & TOTALS games must go at least 8.5 innings if the home team is winning.
- Exhibition games shall be nine inning games or they may be shortened to seven-inning games or five-inning games upon mutual agreement of both managers. Shortened games will be treated as rain shortened games.

**Baseball lines**
Baseball games can be wagered three different ways: Money Line, Run Line and Totals. For the Totals and Run Lines we use a 20 cent line. The favorite has the negative number next to it showing the price you have to lay to play that side and the underdog almost always has a positive number next to it showing the price you would win by playing it. Below is an example of a typical baseball game.

Mets - Hampton-134 9ov -105
Marlins - Dempster+124 9un -115

- If you want to place a $100 wager on the Mets, you would be risking $134 to win $100.
- If you want to place a $100 wager on the Marlins, you would risk $100 to win $124.
- If you want to place a $100 wager on over 9 runs, you would risk $105 to win $100.
- If you want to place a $100 wager on under 9 runs, you would risk $115 to win $100.

When betting Baseball Money Lines you can chose the following options for your wagers: **ACTION, LISTED PITCHERS (LP), YOUR TEAM'S PITCHER (PT) or OPPOSING PITCHER (TP).**

NOTE: The starting pitchers are determined after the first pitch. In the event of a pitching change prior to the game, the money price may be adjusted and your bet may change if you play with action.

**Action:**
Your wager is team against team regardless of who the starting pitchers are. In case of a pitching change, your price will be adjusted to the opening number of the actual starting pitcher.

**Listed Pitchers (LP):**
Your wager is predicated on both listed pitchers throwing at least one pitch for you to have action. Both pitchers must start in order for you to have action on your wager, otherwise the bet will be declared NO ACTION after the game is final.

**Your team's Pitcher (PT):**
You are only taking the listed pitcher of the team you are wagering on. The pitcher selected must start the game for your wager to count. Any pitcher can start for the opposing team. In case of a pitching change on the opposing team, the price will still adjust to the opening price of the actual starters.

**Opposing Pitcher (TP):**
You are listing the opposing team's pitcher. Any starter can pitch for the team you selected. The opposing team's pitcher has to start. In the case of a pitching change on your team, the price will be adjusted to the opening price of the actual pitchers.
The other way to wager on a baseball game is to bet the run-line. Every favorite will be - 1 1/2 runs and could either be plus or minus money.

Below is an example of what a run-line looks like.

Mets - Hampton+1 1/2 +115
Marlins - Dempster-1 1/2 -135
If you wager $100 on the Mets, you have the Mets minus 1 1/2 runs risking $100 to win $115. If you wager $100 on the Marlins, you have the Marlins plus 1 1/2 runs risking $135 to win $100.

**When wagering on Total Runs (over/under) and Run Lines (run spread)** the game must go 9 innings (8 1/2 if the home team is winning). If the game is suspended after 9 innings, the final score (for wagering purposes) is determined by the last full inning of play unless the home team scores to tie or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning. In which case, the winner is determined by the score when the game is called. If with this rules the game is a TIE, Run Lines and Totals count. All wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are ALWAYS with Listed Pitchers (LP). If both pitchers scheduled to pitch at the time of the wager do not throw at least one pitch then the wager will be cancelled. Wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are refunded in the event of a pitching change when the game is final.

We do NOT accept Parlays, If Bets or Round Robins with the same game's Total and Run Line. Any wager of such type can be cancelled by us without prior notice.

**RAIN or SHINE Rule:** Baseball Props including 1st Score, Yes/No Score in 1st inning, 1st 5 inning line are graded as soon as that event occurs. For 1st 5 inning line the game must go into the 6th inning of play for action. Bets are final even if the game gets rained out or suspended.

For any Player prop, the game must be completed in-full to have action. Games that are scheduled for 7 Innings only and are completed (6.5 if home team is winning) are considered completed.

**2ND HALF LINES:** 2nd half baseball score includes from the top of the 6th inning till the end of the game including extra innings. The game must be completed for action (9 full innings or 8.5 innings if the home team is winning). All wagers on the 2nd half lines are action regardless of the pitcher. If Games are suspended and MORE than 9 innings have been played the score will revert back to the last COMPLETE inning.

**For baseball props and Alternate Runlines and Halves**, ALL listed pitchers must go. On the player to get most total bases, the following scoring system is used: Single = 1 base, Double = 2 bases, Triple = 3 bases, HR = 4 bases. Both players + starting pitchers must start for action. On Pool events ALL PLAYERS ARE ACTION unless otherwise specified. Baseball props can be used for Straight bets, Parlays, If Bets and/or Round Robins (NO TEASERS) as long as the other Team in such wagers does not belong to the same Family. Any wagers within the same Family (OR PROPS USED IN TEASERS) will be cancelled by us without prior notice.

**Baseball Series:** Baseball Series are games played between two teams (Regular Season Only). Neither team can play any other opponent between the scheduled games in the series. The following are the main rules used to grade the Baseball Series:

- All games in a series count towards wager. In a four game series 2-2 is a tie.
- A series is considered action if one game has been played.
- If a game during the series is called, this game will be considered good for the series as long as one of the teams is officially declared the winner of the game.
- All wagers are based on ACTION in regard to the pitchers in each games.
- A suspended game from a previous series that is completed is not considered part of the current series.
- These rules may differ from other sportsbooks.

So if a series starts on Friday and ends on Monday, it will be graded out on Monday, with all games counting towards the result.

**College World Series games** (all college baseball games) that are suspended are considered to be in a long rain delay and will be graded when the game reaches its official ending.

**For the World Baseball Classic (WBC)**, during the first two rounds of play, both sides and totals have action regardless of the Mercy Rule. For the Semi Finals and Final of the WBC, the Mercy Rule is not in effect therefore games will follow normal playoff rules. In case of discrepancy or items not covered, Las Vegas gaming rules will apply.

**Totals, Runs, Hits and Errors:** A game must go 8 and a half innings if home team is winning, or 9 if the road team is winning for action.

**GRAND SALAMI** For grand salami wagers, every game on the board has to go the full 9 innings (81/2 if the home team is winning) otherwise it will be cancelled.

Pitchers do not matter, meaning that if there is a pitching change on any game your bet will still have action.

For League Grand Salami, it will only take to account games played on that specific league, example: National League Grand Salami will only include games from the National League schedule and not National League teams that could be playing on Interleague games.

**Exception: Playoff baseball games do not fall under the suspended game rule in accordance to Major League Baseball guidelines to finish all games. If a game is suspended due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until the game is declared final.**
