For soccer games there can be four different types of lines:

**1. Spread Wagering (90 Minutes: 1st and 2nd Halves plus injury time):**
Only includes 1st and 2nd halves plus injury time to decide the winner of the bet. Does not include any shootouts if any or overtime (Extra Periods). The possible results in the game include a home win, an away win or a draw.

**2. To advance/to lift the cup Wagering:**
Includes the 90 minutes regulation time plus any injury or extra times played. You bet on the team that will advance or will be declared the winner of the match, therefore any shootouts help determine the winner. One team must win the match.

**3. Three Way Result (90 Minutes:1st and 2nd Halves plus injury time):**
Includes 1st and 2nd halves and any injury time, does not include overtime or shootouts. You can bet on Team A, Team B or a Tie.

**4. Total Wagering (90 Minutes: 1st and 2nd Halves plus injury time):**
Includes 1st and 2nd halves plus injury time. Does not include shootouts of any or overtime unless specified otherwise.

**5. Correct Score (90 Minutes: 1st and 2nd Halves Plus Injury Time):**
Includes 1st and 2nd Halves plus injury time. Does not include shootouts of any or overtime unless specified otherwise.

**6. Double Result (1st half + game result):**
Includes 1st and 2nd Halves plus injury time. Does not include shootouts of any or overtime unless specified otherwise.

**7. Margin of victory (90 Minutes: 1st and 2nd halves plus injury time):**
Includes 1st and 2nd halves and any injury time. Does not include shootouts of any or overtime unless specified otherwise.

**8. Soccer Props:**
All PROPS are for the 90 minutes regulation time and injury time, they DO NOT include extra times or penalty shootouts unless otherwise specified.

**9. Early/Late goal:**
The grading of these props will be determined by the time of the goal provided by the official website not by the actual time the goal occurred. In soccer if a goal is made at the 22:35 the official time for that goal will be 23:00.

For example, if the time of the Early Goal was set at 26:00 and the goal was made at 25:20 making the official time of that goal 26:00, then NO GOAL BEFORE 26:00 will be the winner.
We do not accept Parlays, If Bets, Reverses or Round Robins with the same game's Three Way Line or Goal Line to the Game Total. . Any such wagers will be cancelled by us without prior notice.
