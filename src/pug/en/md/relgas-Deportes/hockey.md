**60 MINUTE RESULT/REGULATION TIME:** MONEY LINE, PUCK LINE & TOTAL. This wager will be graded after regulation time and DOES NOT include Overtime or Shootouts goals. Any GOALS scored in overtime or in the shootouts DO NOT count towards any wager in the 60 Minute Result/Regulation Time)
- We differentiate the games by adding (REGULATION TIME) to the leagues that are going to be handle this way.

**Example of a Shootout game:** A game goes into overtime with a score of Team A 3 and Team B 3 (tied 3-3) and no team scores in the Overtime period. The winner of the shootouts will be awarded a goal making the final score Team A 4 and Team B 3. With this result the total for both teams combined will be 7. Any 60 MINUTE RESULT wagers will be decided with the 60 minute result of 3-3 tie.
