<li>Games are official after 5 innings of play unless the home team is winning after 4 and a half innings.</li>
<li>After 5 innings of play, if the game is called or suspended, the final score (for wagering purposes) is determined by the last full inning of play unless the home team scores to tie or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning. In which case, the winner is determined by the score when the game is called.</li>
<li>Regular Season Games that are suspended or postponed do not carry over to the following day. However, for MLB PostSeason, World Baseball Classic (WBC) Final and Semi Finals games that are suspended or postponed, bets will carry over until the game is ruled final.</li>
<li>College World Series games that are suspended are considered to be in a long rain delay and will be graded when the game reaches its official ending.</li>
<li>Scheduled 7 Inning MLB Games: For Runline (Spread) and Total (over/under) wagers to have action, the game must go 7 innings or 6Â½ if the home team is winning.</li>
<li>On Mexican Baseball games for action on RUN LINES &amp; TOTALS games must go at least 8.5 innings if the home team is winning.</li>
<li>Exhibition games shall be nine inning games or they may be shortened to seven-inning games or five-inning games upon mutual agreement of both managers. Shortened games will be treated as rain shortened games.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Baseball lines</strong>
Baseball games can be wagered three different ways: Money Line, Run Line and Totals. For the Totals and Run Lines we use a 20 cent line. The favorite has the negative number next to it showing the price you have to lay to play that side and the underdog almost always has a positive number next to it showing the price you would win by playing it. Below is an example of a typical baseball game.</p>
<p>Mets - Hampton-134 9ov -105
Marlins - Dempster+124 9un -115</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on the Mets, you would be risking $134 to win $100.</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on the Marlins, you would risk $100 to win $124.</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on over 9 runs, you would risk $105 to win $100.</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on under 9 runs, you would risk $115 to win $100.</li>
</ul>
<p>When betting Baseball Money Lines you can chose the following options for your wagers: <strong>ACTION, LISTED PITCHERS (LP), YOUR TEAM'S PITCHER (PT) or OPPOSING PITCHER (TP).</strong></p>
<p>NOTE: The starting pitchers are determined after the first pitch. In the event of a pitching change prior to the game, the money price may be adjusted and your bet may change if you play with action.</p>
<p><strong>Action:</strong>
Your wager is team against team regardless of who the starting pitchers are. In case of a pitching change, your price will be adjusted to the opening number of the actual starting pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>Listed Pitchers (LP):</strong>
Your wager is predicated on both listed pitchers throwing at least one pitch for you to have action. Both pitchers must start in order for you to have action on your wager, otherwise the bet will be declared NO ACTION after the game is final.</p>
<p><strong>Your team's Pitcher (PT):</strong>
You are only taking the listed pitcher of the team you are wagering on. The pitcher selected must start the game for your wager to count. Any pitcher can start for the opposing team. In case of a pitching change on the opposing team, the price will still adjust to the opening price of the actual starters.</p>
<p><strong>Opposing Pitcher (TP):</strong>
You are listing the opposing team's pitcher. Any starter can pitch for the team you selected. The opposing team's pitcher has to start. In the case of a pitching change on your team, the price will be adjusted to the opening price of the actual pitchers.
The other way to wager on a baseball game is to bet the run-line. Every favorite will be - 1 1/2 runs and could either be plus or minus money.</p>
<p>Below is an example of what a run-line looks like.</p>
<p>Mets - Hampton+1 1/2 +115
Marlins - Dempster-1 1/2 -135
If you wager $100 on the Mets, you have the Mets minus 1 1/2 runs risking $100 to win $115. If you wager $100 on the Marlins, you have the Marlins plus 1 1/2 runs risking $135 to win $100.</p>
<p><strong>When wagering on Total Runs (over/under) and Run Lines (run spread)</strong> the game must go 9 innings (8 1/2 if the home team is winning). If the game is suspended after 9 innings, the final score (for wagering purposes) is determined by the last full inning of play unless the home team scores to tie or takes the lead in the bottom half of the inning. In which case, the winner is determined by the score when the game is called. If with this rules the game is a TIE, Run Lines and Totals count. All wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are ALWAYS with Listed Pitchers (LP). If both pitchers scheduled to pitch at the time of the wager do not throw at least one pitch then the wager will be cancelled. Wagers on Total Runs and Run Lines are refunded in the event of a pitching change when the game is final.</p>
<p>We do NOT accept Parlays, If Bets or Round Robins with the same game's Total and Run Line. Any wager of such type can be cancelled by us without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>RAIN or SHINE Rule:</strong> Baseball Props including 1st Score, Yes/No Score in 1st inning, 1st 5 inning line are graded as soon as that event occurs. For 1st 5 inning line the game must go into the 6th inning of play for action. Bets are final even if the game gets rained out or suspended.</p>
<p>For any Player prop, the game must be completed in-full to have action. Games that are scheduled for 7 Innings only and are completed (6.5 if home team is winning) are considered completed.</p>
<p><strong>2ND HALF LINES:</strong> 2nd half baseball score includes from the top of the 6th inning till the end of the game including extra innings. The game must be completed for action (9 full innings or 8.5 innings if the home team is winning). All wagers on the 2nd half lines are action regardless of the pitcher. If Games are suspended and MORE than 9 innings have been played the score will revert back to the last COMPLETE inning.</p>
<p><strong>For baseball props and Alternate Runlines and Halves</strong>, ALL listed pitchers must go. On the player to get most total bases, the following scoring system is used: Single = 1 base, Double = 2 bases, Triple = 3 bases, HR = 4 bases. Both players + starting pitchers must start for action. On Pool events ALL PLAYERS ARE ACTION unless otherwise specified. Baseball props can be used for Straight bets, Parlays, If Bets and/or Round Robins (NO TEASERS) as long as the other Team in such wagers does not belong to the same Family. Any wagers within the same Family (OR PROPS USED IN TEASERS) will be cancelled by us without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>Baseball Series:</strong> Baseball Series are games played between two teams (Regular Season Only). Neither team can play any other opponent between the scheduled games in the series. The following are the main rules used to grade the Baseball Series:</p>
<ul>
<li>All games in a series count towards wager. In a four game series 2-2 is a tie.</li>
<li>A series is considered action if one game has been played.</li>
<li>If a game during the series is called, this game will be considered good for the series as long as one of the teams is officially declared the winner of the game.</li>
<li>All wagers are based on ACTION in regard to the pitchers in each games.</li>
<li>A suspended game from a previous series that is completed is not considered part of the current series.</li>
<li>These rules may differ from other sportsbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>So if a series starts on Friday and ends on Monday, it will be graded out on Monday, with all games counting towards the result.</p>
<p><strong>College World Series games</strong> (all college baseball games) that are suspended are considered to be in a long rain delay and will be graded when the game reaches its official ending.</p>
<p><strong>For the World Baseball Classic (WBC)</strong>, during the first two rounds of play, both sides and totals have action regardless of the Mercy Rule. For the Semi Finals and Final of the WBC, the Mercy Rule is not in effect therefore games will follow normal playoff rules. In case of discrepancy or items not covered, Las Vegas gaming rules will apply.</p>
<p><strong>Totals, Runs, Hits and Errors:</strong> A game must go 8 and a half innings if home team is winning, or 9 if the road team is winning for action.</p>
<p><strong>GRAND SALAMI</strong> For grand salami wagers, every game on the board has to go the full 9 innings (81/2 if the home team is winning) otherwise it will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Pitchers do not matter, meaning that if there is a pitching change on any game your bet will still have action.</p>
<p>For League Grand Salami, it will only take to account games played on that specific league, example: National League Grand Salami will only include games from the National League schedule and not National League teams that could be playing on Interleague games.</p>
<p><strong>Exception: Playoff baseball games do not fall under the suspended game rule in accordance to Major League Baseball guidelines to finish all games. If a game is suspended due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until the game is declared final.</strong></p>
<h2>Softball and Little League</h2>
<p>Softball or little league game ending early as a result of a mercy rule will have action on all wagers (unless otherwise noted). If a game is suspended or postponed due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until the game is final.</p>
<p>NCAA regular season Softball --- Games ending early as a result of a mercy rule will have action on all wagers (unless otherwise noted). If a game is suspended or postponed due to weather or darkness all bets will be considered NO ACTION</p>
<p>NCAA Post season --- Games ending early as a result of a mercy rule will have action on all wagers including TOTALS (unless otherwise noted). If a game is suspended or postponed due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until the game is final.</p>
<p>Little League Baseball --- Games ending early as a result of a mercy rule will have action on all wagers including TOTALS (unless otherwise noted). If a game is suspended or postponed due to weather or darkness all bets will remain pending until the game is final.</p>

<li>Games are official after 55 minutes of play.</li>
<li>Wagering will be accepted using the Goal line (Puck line), Money line (3 way line) or Total Goals Scored (over/under) in the game by both teams.</li>
<li>We offer two types of Hockey games:
<strong>COMPLETE GAME RESULT:</strong> MONEY LINE, PUCK LINE &amp; TOTAL. The game must be played to completion. In the event of a game being decided in overtime or a penalty shootout, then one goal will be added to the winning teamâ€™s score.
<strong>60 MINUTE RESULT/REGULATION TIME:</strong> MONEY LINE, PUCK LINE &amp; TOTAL. This wager will be graded after regulation time and DOES NOT include Overtime or Shootouts goals. Any GOALS scored in overtime or in the shootouts DO NOT count towards any wager in the 60 Minute Result/Regulation Time)</li>
<li>We differentiate the games by adding (REGULATION TIME) to the leagues that are going to be handle this way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of a typical Hockey game.</p>
<p>Penguins-145 5.5 -150
Sharks+125 5.4 +130
GL Penguins-1 1/2 +130
GL Sharks+1 1/2 -150</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on the Penguins, you would be risking $145 to win $100</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on the Sharks, you would risk $100 to win $125.</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on over 5.5 goals, you would risk $150 to win $100.</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on under 5.5 goals, you would risk $100 to win $130.</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on GL Penguins -1 1/2 goals, you would risk $100 to win $130.</li>
<li>If you want to place a $100 wager on GL Sharks +1 1/2 goals, you would risk $150 to win $100.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example of a Shootout game:</strong> A game goes into overtime with a score of Team A 3 and Team B 3 (tied 3-3) and no team scores in the Overtime period. The winner of the shootouts will be awarded a goal making the final score Team A 4 and Team B 3. With this result the total for both teams combined will be 7. Any 60 MINUTE RESULT wagers will be decided with the 60 minute result of 3-3 tie.</p>
<p><strong>Hockey Props</strong> including 1st Score, 1 Period line are graded as soon as that event occurs. Bets are final even if the game gets suspended.
<strong>On player props</strong>, both players must play in the game for action. On Pool events <strong>ALL PLAYERS ARE ACTION</strong> unless otherwise specified. On Pool events <strong>ALL PLAYERS ARE ACTION</strong> unless otherwise specified.

<p><strong>2. To advance/to lift the cup Wagering:</strong>
Includes the 90 minutes regulation time plus any injury or extra times played. You bet on the team that will advance or will be declared the winner of the match, therefore any shootouts help determine the winner. One team must win the match.</p>
<p><strong>3. Three Way Result (90 Minutes:1st and 2nd Halves plus injury time):</strong>
Includes 1st and 2nd halves and any injury time, does not include overtime or shootouts. You can bet on Team A, Team B or a Tie.</p>

<p><strong>9. Early/Late goal:</strong>
The grading of these props will be determined by the time of the goal provided by the official website not by the actual time the goal occurred. In soccer if a goal is made at the 22:35 the official time for that goal will be 23:00.</p>
<p>For example, if the time of the Early Goal was set at 26:00 and the goal was made at 25:20 making the official time of that goal 26:00, then NO GOAL BEFORE 26:00 will be the winner.
We do not accept Parlays, If Bets, Reverses or Round Robins with the same game's Three Way Line or Goal Line to the Game Total. . Any such wagers will be cancelled by us without prior notice.</p>

              <p class="a-btn">GOLF <span></span></p>
              <div class="a-panel"><p><strong>These are the ways that we offer for Golf Betting:</strong></p>
<p><br>
<strong>- To Win the Tournament:</strong> Customers bet on one of the players to be the champion of the Tournament.
<strong>- To Finish in the Top 5:</strong> The Top 5 finishers and anybody who tied with the fifth finisher.
<strong>- To Finish in the Top 10:</strong> The Top 10 finishers and anybody who tied with the tenth finisher.
<strong>- Match-ups:</strong> We pair up players and the customer picks one of them to have a better record than the other. We offer Match-ups for the entire tournament and on major events we also offer Round Match-ups betting.</p>
<p><strong>- 3 Ball Betting:</strong> In 3 Ball Betting 3 golfers are matched up and the golfer with the best score wins the pool. 3 Ball Betting can be offered for the entire tournament or for a specific round. If two players are tied for the win in the pool then prices will be split between the number of winning players (2). If the 3 players are all tied in their scores then the 3 Ball Betting is considered NO ACTION and all wagers will be refunded.</p>
<p><strong>- 6 Ball Shooter:</strong> In 6 Ball Shooters 6 golfers are matched up and the golfer with the best score wins the pool. 6 Ball Shooter can be offered for the entire tournament or for the specific round. If two players are tied for the win in the pool then prices will be split between the number of winning players. If the 6 players are all tied in their scores then the 3 Ball Betting is considered NO ACTION and all wagers will be refunded.</p>
<p><strong>- Top Player in a group:</strong> On major tournaments we offer pools such as TOP AMERICAN player in the tournament. In such pools if ties for the best position occur, the prices will be split between the number of winning players.</p>
<p><strong>- Round Leader:</strong> On major tournaments we offer a pool for the best score in a specific round of play. In such pools if ties for the best score occur, the prices will be split between the number of winning players.</p>
<p><br>
<strong>For Matchups</strong> the player must tee off in order to be considered action. If a player does not tee off, then any wager involving him would be considered no action and will be cancelled.The exception to this rule is when the wager is made on a pool and all players have action regardless if they start or not the tournament. (ex: to win TOURNAMENT)</p>
<p><strong>If a players tees off</strong>, he is in action regardless of the number of holes played.</p>
<p><strong>Example of a Tournament Matchup:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fred Funk -125</strong>
<strong>Joe Durant +105</strong>
In this tournament match-If a customer picks Fred Funk, the wager is on Fred Funk to have a better record than Joe Durant. Not necessarily that Funk must win the championship but that he will end up in a better position than Durant. Both players must Tee Off in the tournament for the matchup to have action. In a two-player match-up wager, the player completing the most holes is declared the winner. If both players complete the same number of holes then the lowest score wins.</p>
<p><strong>Specific Rounds:</strong> Aside the odds to win the whole Tournament, we may also offer odds to win a specific round. So a customer can bet on a player to win the 3rd round only. If this is the case we will specify that the bet is for the round only and not for the whole tournament. Both players must tee off in the specified round for action. 4th round does not include playoffs</p>
<p><strong>When a point scoring method is used</strong> such as Stableford, then the highest number of point wins. The only exception to this rule is when a tournament is rain shortened and the final scores are determined by the PGA usually by reverting back to the last completed round.</p>
<p>On Top Player betting or Group betting if two or more players tie for the best place in the pool, the prices of the wagers will be divided by the number of the winning players.</p>
<p>We ONLY accept Straight Bets when wagering on Golf regardless if it is a wager on To Win Tournament, Top 5, Top 10, Tournament Matchups, Round Matchups or Top Player Betting. Any other type of wager that is not a straight wager (Example: Parlays, If Bets, Reverses and/or Round Robins) will be cancelled by us without prior notice.</p>

              <div class="a-panel"><p><strong>For boxing there are three types of wagers:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. To Win the Fight:</strong> Picking the fighter that the customer thinks will win the fight. Draws will cancel these wagers.
<strong>2. Total of Rounds:</strong> Customer will either go over or under a number of rounds in which the fight will be finished.
<strong>3. Correct Result Wagering:</strong> Players can wager on which boxer will win the fight and the manner in which the fight is won. A KNOCKOUT includes Technical Knockouts (TKO) and Disqualifications (DQ). A DECISION is determined to be anytime the judge's scorecards are used to determine the winner of the bout regardless of the round in which this occurs. DRAW is a wagering option and if a DRAW occurs the other Correct Result Wagers will be losers.</p>
<p>Lets say the line on the rounds in a fight is 4.5 (3 minutes). If a player takes the over, he's saying that the fight will last more than 4.5 rounds. That would be 4 full rounds and the first 1.5 minutes into the 5th round (1 minute and 30 seconds).</p>

<p>The start dates and times displayed on our website for E-Sport matches are an indication only and are not guaranteed to be correct. If a match is suspended or postponed, and not resumed within 12 hours from the actual scheduled start time, then wagers on the match will have no action and be refunded.

<p><strong>Handicap betting:</strong> A spread in E-Sports can be Rounds/Maps or other counting measures dependent on the game. The spread will only be referred to as the spread. (For example, in Counter Strike the spread will be rounds won, while in Starcraft 2 the spread would be maps).
Handicapping is a way of making a sports contest more even and thus more interesting as a betting object. In E-Sports betting, this is done by awarding one of the teams/players, the underdog, some maps/rounds ahead</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Handicap</strong></th>
<th><strong>Odds</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Player A</td>
<td>-1.5</td>
<td>2.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Player B</td>
<td>+1.5</td>
<td>1.85</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If Player A wins the match by two maps or more, Player A bettors win and Player B bettors lose. If Player A wins by exactly one map or Player B wins, Player B bettors win and Player A bettors lose.</p>
<p>Total Betting: A total in E-sports can be Rounds/Maps or other counting measures dependent on the game. The total will only be referred to as the total.
<strong>Example for a best of three SC2 Match:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Over</td>
<td>2.5</td>
<td>1.93</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Under</td>
<td>2.5</td>
<td>1.93</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If either player wins 2-0 all bets on under 2.5 will win, while bets on the over will lose. If either player wins 2-1 all bets on the over win, while bets on the under lose.</p>
<p>If a map is not completed because of a player retirement or disqualification, all bets on the outcome will have action and will be validated based on the official declared winner. Counter-Strike maps are exceptions to this rule, for which all moneyline, spread and total bets are canceled if a team retires or is disqualified before all scheduled map rounds are played.
If the announced number of maps/rounds is changed all bets on the handicap or total are cancelled. Bets on the moneyline (outcome of the match) have action.
If a player or team receives a walkover or win by admin decision on at least one map, all wagers on the series (moneyline, spread and total) will be canceled and monies refunded. In CS:GO, if a team retires or is disqualified before all scheduled rounds on a map are played, all wagers on the series (moneylines, spread and total) will be canceled and monies refunded as well.</p>
